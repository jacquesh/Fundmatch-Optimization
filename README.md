# Abstract
Holding companies need to manage the need and usage of money available to their subsidiaries. This is done by making loans between subsidiaries in order to satisfy those that require additional funds. The problem of fund matching optimization is to determine the set of loans which will satisfy all funding requirements at the lowest total cost. We investigate the use of Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization in addressing this problem. We evaluate both algorithms on a real-world instance of the problem as well as a variety of randomly generated instances. Particle Swarm Optimization performs poorly on all problem instances that we tested, but we find that the Genetic Algorithm performs better on average than existing manual and heuristic approaches.
